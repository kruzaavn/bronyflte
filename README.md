# BronyFlte

## What is BronyFlte 

Since CombatFlite went behind a paywall this module is intended to support
quality of life features for planning JTF-191 missions. 

## Installation

create a python/conda virtual environment, currently on mac it's recommended to 
use python 3.8 for plotly compatibility.

once your virtual environment has been set up and activated, install the required
dependencies in the requirements file by running the following command. 

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

in addition, this module is reliant on [PyDCS](https://github.com/pydcs/dcs) for 
DCS mission parsing. Clone the latest version of the repo and install it by running

```python setup.py install```
